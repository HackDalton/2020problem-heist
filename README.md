# HackDalton: Heist

You and [your friends with city names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Heist) decide to break into the Royal Mint of Spain to print 2.4 billion euros without stealing a cent from anyone*. You're in charge of disarming the security system before you break in. You were able to find a copy of the software used. Connect to the Royal Mint of Spain's security system with `nc problems.hackdalton.com 24482`.

\*I guess technically you're stealing from everyone who uses the Euro by reducing the value of it, but that would be negligible. Also, the TV show doesn't address it.
